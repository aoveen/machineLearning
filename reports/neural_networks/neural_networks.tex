\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section{Implementation Details}
\subsection{Cross-Validation}
summary of implementation details, e.g. how we performed cross-validation
\subsection{Classification}
how we classified each example based on the 6 outputs, anything we think is important
flow chart

\section{Evaluation Process}

\subsection{Finding Optimal Parameters}
how we obtained the optimal parameters, topology
How should we be optimising parameters (not in the first fold only)
different topologies and parameters we experimented with
\subsection{Performance measure}
performance measure we used why we preferred it over other ones
\subsection{Avoiding Overfitting}
what strategy to avoid overfitting and find good generalisation

\section{Results}

any difference between the average classification performance of the two types, both clean and noisy data. Discuss advantages and disadvantages

Commented results on average confusion matrices for both types of network and both clean and noisy with 
	- avg. classification rate
	- recall rate, precision rate, and F1 per class

figures of the average performance per fold for both types and nosiy/clean; discussion
